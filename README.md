Intro to Eth
  This is a simple solidity program that has a 3 public variables, 1 mapping variable, and 2 functions. The overall purpose of this program is to create a token, name it, add to its total supply and to a given address, and subtract or burn from the total supply and from the balance of the address. This serves as the project to the intro to eth modules.
